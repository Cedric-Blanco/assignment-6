# Assignment-6
A frequency and string comparison site with button decoration using only DOM API and JavaScript.

## Learning Experience
This site has refreshed my knowledge that you can do many things in JavaScript, such as styling.
Something important that I learned is where to properly link certain things, like the placement
of my script tag which is something that I had struggled with in the project.
